            In this Groundhog Day from Hell, you play as the last of an order of holy warriors sworn to
            protect the once great kingdom of Prav.  Slay demons and uncover hidden abilities as you
            scour the lands of Asha to recover the four Earth Stones.  These sacred stones hold the
            key to reuniting the world under the source and creator of all, the good lord Ahba.
            Act fast as the dark lord Daal and his forces grow stronger by the minute.
            Offer prayers at shrines to receive blessings and find memory stones to remember them when you die.

            who cares?  You have free will, for now.
