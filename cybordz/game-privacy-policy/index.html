        <h2>Privacy Policy for Cybordz</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Last Updated: August 23, 2025</b></p>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Penitent Games, LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you play our game or provide feedback. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.
        </p>
        
        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            We collect the following types of information during your participation in the prototype:
        </p>
        <h4>a. Gameplay Analytics</h4>
        <p>To improve Cybordz, we collect gameplay metrics, such as actions taken (e.g., tricks performed, upgrades installed, buttons clicked) and session duration.
            You can choose one of two analytics options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Linked Analytics:</b> We use your Steam ID to connect gameplay metrics with optional feedback survey responses for deeper analysis. Steam IDs are considered personal information under data protection laws.</li>
            <li><b>Anonymous Analytics:</b> We generate a random, non-identifiable player ID locally on your device to track gameplay metrics. This ID cannot be linked to you or your Steam account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unity Analytics may also collect certain personal information (e.g., device information, IP address) 
            as described in the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy">Unity Privacy Policy</a>.
            However, if you opt-out of analytics completely we instruct Unity to not collect any data from you.</p>
        
        <h4>b. Feedback Surveys &amp; Bug Reports</h4>
        <p>If you choose to provide feedback via our optional survey form, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Steam ID (if you select Linked Analytics) to associate your survey responses with gameplay metrics.</li>
            <li>Optional information you provide, such as your name or email address, if you choose to include it in the survey form. Providing this information is entirely voluntary.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>c. Other Information</h4>
        <p>We do not collect any other personal information (e.g., IP addresses, device identifiers)
            beyond what is collected by Unity Analytics (see their <a 
                    href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>) or 
            provided by you voluntarily in surveys &amp; bug reports.  If you contact us directly (e.g., via email),
            we may collect the information you provide to respond to your inquiry.</p>
        
        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze gameplay metrics (via Unity Analytics) to improve Cybordz's design, performance, and player 
                experience.</li>
            <li>Link survey responses &amp; bug reports with gameplay data to understand player feedback in 
                context.</li>
            <li>Respond to your inquiries or support requests if you contact us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your information for marketing, advertising, or any purpose other than improving the prototype.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Legal Basis for Processing (For EU/EEA Players)</h3>
        <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), our legal basis for processing your data is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Consent:</b> For Linked Analytics (using Steam IDs) and optional survey responses (e.g., name or email), we rely on your explicit consent, which you provide when starting the game or submitting a survey.</li>
            <li><b>Legitimate Interests:</b> For Anonymous Analytics, we rely on our legitimate interest in improving the game, as this data cannot be linked to you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, share, or transfer your information to third parties, except:</p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>With <b>Unity Analytics</b>, a third-party service that processes gameplay metrics on our behalf.
                Unity’s data practices are governed by their <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
                We configure Unity Analytics to collect only the data necessary for improving the game.</li>
            <li>With <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b>, which hosts our survey &amp; bug report infrastructure.</li>
            <li>If required by law, such as to comply with a legal obligation or protect our rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anonymous Analytics data is not shared in a way that could identify you, unless you choose to provide identifying information (e.g., email) in a Feedback Survey or Bug Report.</p>
            
        <h3>5. Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Storage:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gameplay metrics are processed by Unity Analytics and stored on Unity's servers, as described
                        in their <a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy">Privacy 
                            Policy</a>.</li>
                    <li>Survey responses &amp; bug reports are stored securely on our AWS infrastructure in the United 
                        States.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Security:</b> We and our service providers (Unity and AWS) use industry-standard measures, such as 
                encryption and secure transmission (e.g., HTTPS), to protect your data.  For example, AWS uses 
                encryption for data at rest and in transit.</li>
            <li><b>Retention:</b> We retain gameplay metrics and survey responses only for as long as needed to analyze
                feedback and improve the prototype, typically 6 months after the prototype testing phase ends.
                Anonymous data may be retained longer for statistical analysis, as it cannot identify you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6. Your Choices and Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Analytics Options:</b> When you start the game, you can choose Anonymous Analytics, Linked Analytics, or Decline data collection.</li>
            <li><b>Surveys &amp; Bug Reports:</b> Providing a name, email, or other information in surveys is optional. You can participate without providing this information.</li>
            <li>
